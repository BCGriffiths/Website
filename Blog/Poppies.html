      So I have a favourite flower. Admittedly it’s a rather strange choice, but I adore the flower for both the way it looks and what it represents. The poppy is probably most synonymous with Remembrance Day but for me personally it carries a more interesting story than Flanders field.

      The poppy is genuinely a pretty flower, with colours from a deep red to a regal purple. A long stem and a neat symmetrical circular shape gives the flower a very distinct look. The flower tends to grow in large groups that create long waves of colour along fields of green. Its not exactly gun shy either, it grows pretty much everywhere. Morocco, California, Northern France, Afghanistan, Ecuador all have plant.

      The most common interpretation of the flower is the one gathered from November 11th, remembrance, consolation and a reminder of the trouble of war.
      However whenever I read “In Flanders Field”, I find myself drawn to the third stanza more than anything else. The image that no matter how hard somethings may be, they must be done, and if you fail, someone will be there to carry the torch and go where you could not. That sense of solidarity and obligation we owe to those who have come before us is something I find very interesting. From a purely sentimental stand point it carries a strong weight behind it, and from a more pragmatic view it’s a solid way to approach many problems we encounter in life. We are never alone, and you can rely on those that are around you, even the people that came before and go after.
      Alas that is more my personal view on a poem attached to the imagery of the poppy, but is also a reason why it’s my favourite flower, and not the only one.

      Looking at the poppy directly we can see some interesting things show themselves. The flower is very strongly attached to a large element of human history. And I mean “human” history, not the history of humans. It’s seeds can be used for food, the flower produces opium, and is found in many wars in modern history.

      Poppyseed is a rather enjoyable commodity I will be honest. There is nothing better than a poppyseed muffin and a cup of rooibos tea on a stormy day, lights out (loadshedding is nice) and enjoying the smell of petrichor and ozone. Admittedly this one is a more personal anecdote for why I like the flower but I think these personal experiences are just as, if not more valuable then the rest.

      Drugs, who doesn’t love drugs (I don’t love drugs). These miserable things have many a great moment attached to them. They are attached to humans much the same way as love and war. They are used in religious ceremonies, as uhh aphrodisiacs, love potions and just general daily life. Heroin is no exception, we use it in everything from medicine(morphine) to recreation(heroin). A natural relaxant, the drug was used to treat shell shock in WW1 vets (Oh look, back at that war!) and forms the basis of the US’s opioid crisis. So why does this drug mean I like the flower? It’s a plain and simple reminder, a sword with no hilt, and a look onto the slippery slope we call life.

      War, the fundamental state of human existence. Conflict over land, food and ideology is a large driving force for much of history and the poppy is intrusively tied to much of the most modern ones. Even the abstract nonsense ones like the War on Drugs are connected to the small flower. The Anglo-Chinese Opium Wars and World War One are the most obvious with Flanders Field and the drug the flower makes, but it is even tied to the recent Us-Afghan war. The flowers has a story seeped in blood and iron that would make the most melodramatic theatre majors cringe from overuse and tacked on symbolism. Nonetheless the flower is pithy to some of our darkest moments in history and an elegant reminder of them.

      The Poppy is my favourite flower. A simple but strong reminder of human nature even on a personal level. A pretty flower that speaks more than a picture’s thousand words. A plant that keeps dogging human history from Egyptian Pharaohs to a gardens spring bloom. A flower that I rather like.
