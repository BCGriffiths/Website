    <h3>      About Me    </h3>
    <p>
      Hello World, I am a nineteen year old uni student from Johannesburg South Africa. I spend most of my time behind some screen at my house, and have lost a fair amount of time to walls of pixels. I love to code with a preference for the C family of languages, admittedly C++ for the most part but I have fiddled around with both C and C#. I also enjoy reading and writing with some of my favourite books being Orwell's 1984, Conan-Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and the fantasy classic called Lord of The Rings. I've tried writing some novels but their four chapter long carcasses litter my pc's documents folder. I have had more success with shortform stuff like poems and essays and you should be able to find my most interesting stuff in the blog down below. I occasionally write on my uni projects as well, if I find them interesting enough but I highly doubt my six-thousand word long cursory analysis of a depth first search algorithm will interest most people anyway. I also admittedly enjoy video games a fair amount, having sunk a couple thousand hours into various titles mostly FPS's and RTS's like Battlefield and Heart's of Iron IV. I'm fairly ambitious as well, having tried to create several large programs that have fallen by the wayside. I like to post most of my stuff to my github page regardless of their completeness and you can probably grasp the kind of things I like to work on from their. However the about me section of anything out to tell you so, I like to play around with machine learning, mostly neural networks in complex enviroments like a stock market, game development, cellular automata and various other things that catch my interest at any given moment. My long term goals in my life are to publish a novel, create a programming language and write a small simple Operating System. I'd also love to one day work on rockets, mostly the guidance computer that can be found in things like SpaceX's self-landing Falcon 9 and Starship, but honestly anything in that career field is just too alluring to not have on a CV somewhere. So, yeah, thats pretty much all the most interesting stuff about me. A uni student with a love for programming, writing, reading and fiddling. Not too special in this day and age but nonetheless I'd like to think my personality is unique enough that someone somewhere will find me fun.

    <h3>      My blog    </h3>
    <p>
      A blog in this day and age! On a personel website, and not twitter or reddit! Magic I dare say. Honestly I'm setting this thing up as a space for my personal musings and as webdev practice. Nothing fancy and nothing crazy but I hope you enjoy whatever you suffer through.
